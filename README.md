Search for images with Python3 and Selenium.

I wanted to showcase computer automation for an upcoming project. The user is able to search from the command line and then
view the results in a browser.

Chrome or Firefox will work so long as you have the accompanying selenium web-drivers installed.

Best practice would be to git clone this repo cd into the directory and setup a virtualenv specifying python3

Then Install requirements.txt

By always using virtualenv you won't accidentally break anything.
